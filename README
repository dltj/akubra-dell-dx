This is an initial attempt to get our Caringo adapter for akubra
packaged up as a maven project.

As is I believe it contains all of our code and the dependencies
except for the Caringo code. As far as I can tell most, but not all,
of that is open source, but I think that we need some of the
proprietary stuff.

Also Caringo included third party jars in their SDK. However, 
some of these appear to vary from the standard versions (e.g.
added methods). Since I don't know their IP status either, they
aren't included either. There is merely a system dependency set
up in the pom.xml file.

So as things are now one needs to drop the CAStorSDK.jar and their
third party jars from the Caringo SDK into lib and set up the project
to build with them. Perhaps someone with more java/maven experience
can come up with a better way to do this.
