This is an initial attempt to get our Caringo adapter for akubra
packaged up as a maven project.

As is I believe it contains all of our code and the dependencies except for the
Caringo code. As far as I can tell most, but not all, of that is open source, but
I think that we need some of the proprietary stuff.

So as things are now one needs to drop the CAStorSDK.jar from the Caringo SDK into
lib and set up the project to build with it. Perhaps someone with more java/maven
experience can come up with a better way to do this.
