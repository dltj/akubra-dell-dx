This is an initial attempt to get our Caringo adapter for akubra
packaged up as a maven project.

As is I believe it contains all of our code and the dependencies
except for the Caringo code. As far as I can tell most, but not all,
of that is open source, but I think that we need some of the
proprietary stuff.

Also Caringo included third party jars in their SDK. However, 
some of these appear to vary from the standard versions (e.g.
added methods). Since I don't know their IP status either, they
aren't included either.

After some fooling around with this, I think that the way to get
all this to work with maven is the following. Take each of Caringo's
jar and install them into the local maven repository. 

E.g. 
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/jmdns-2.1.jar -DgroupId=com.caringo
-DartifactId=jmdns -Dversion=2.1 -Dpackaging=jar

(for the CaringoSDK itself I'd mint a version of 1.0)

Then they can be declared as dependencies in the normal way and things
should work.

Note that for anything that seems to be already in the fedora set up where
there may be version conflicts it would be possible to change the
dependency scope to provided (most likely). This would leave it out of the
jar that is produced. E.g. slf4j seems to fall into this category. It 
may require some experimentation to figure out exactly how it shoule be.
