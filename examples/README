akubra-llstore.xml - this is an example for the Fedora digital repository
system. You'd use a config file like this in $FEDORA_HOME/server/config.
The main difference from the file system config file is that the two stores 
(one each for fedora objects and datastreams) are replaced with akubra-caringo
classes as appropriate as are the mappers for each. The stores are 
constructed with a file system path to a properties file that contains 
configuration information. Typically the same properties file and 
configuration settings may be used for both, although if you have special
needs you may want to make them different.

akubra-llstore.properties - this is an example of configuration settings for
the akubra plugin. It contains such things as connection configuration for
the storage system, configuration for the blob store itself, and optional
configurations such as authentication and counter router connection
information. It can reside anywhere as long as akubra-llstore.xml is 
configured with the right path, although $FEDORA_HOME/server/config seems
like a logical place for it.

dx-rules-unfiltered.xml - an example of how you might configure the storage's
content router in order to be able to enumerate the named objects of a 
collection. Note that the Fedora blob stores distinguish if a storage named
object is a fedora data stream or object, so the content router rules can
be simple and enumerate all of the fedora streams.
