            I wonder if we could do better on this. As is, it pulls the entire stream from Caringo, writes
            to a temporary file, and the provided input stream is an InputStream on that file.
            One possibility (depending on what the requirements of this InputStream are) might be to
            use the ability to fetch pieces of a datastream (does the CaringoSDK support this) and expose
            them via a circular buffer or piped input stream. So maybe create a piped input stream, hook it
            to a piped output stream. Spin off a thread that does an info on the object to get the size then
            reads it piece by piece and writes to the pipe. Overall this might be less efficient, but for
            large files data would start to appear earlier.

            Probably the corresponding idea for writing to Caringo is less important, since there's not really
            any possible visible result until the entire operation is complete.
